# Too Good To Go: Backend

Go + Gin backend, organized with Clean Architecture.

## Run

Requires Go 1.24+.

```bash
go run ./cmd/api
```

That's the only command needed. (On a fresh clone without `go.sum`, run
`go mod tidy` once first and commit the generated `go.sum`.) Configuration comes from environment variables
(see `.env.example`). Every variable has a safe development default, so the
server starts without any setup. To override values locally:

```bash
cp .env.example .env     # Windows: copy .env.example .env
```

Real environment variables always take precedence over `.env`. The `.env` file
is parsed by `godotenv`; application-specific types and constraints are then
validated by the config loader. Invalid values (e.g. `HTTP_PORT=abc`) stop
startup with an error listing every bad variable.

Check it is up:

```bash
curl -i http://localhost:8080/health
```

Run tests:

```bash
go test ./...
```

The dependency graph is generated with Google Wire. After changing providers in
`internal/injector/wire.go`, regenerate the checked-in implementation with:

```bash
go generate ./internal/injector
```

Build a binary with a version stamp:

```bash
go build -ldflags "-X main.version=v0.1.0" -o bin/api ./cmd/api
```

## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `APP_ENV` | `development` | `development`, `staging` or `production` |
| `HTTP_HOST` | (all interfaces) | Listen host |
| `HTTP_PORT` | `8080` | Listen port |
| `HTTP_READ_TIMEOUT` | `10s` | Max time to read a request |
| `HTTP_WRITE_TIMEOUT` | `15s` | Max time to write a response |
| `HTTP_IDLE_TIMEOUT` | `60s` | Keep-alive idle timeout |
| `HTTP_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT` | `10s` | Grace period for in-flight requests on SIGINT/SIGTERM |
| `HEALTH_CHECK_TIMEOUT` | `2s` | Timeout per dependency check in `/health` |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | `info` | `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error` |
| `JWT_SECRET` | (random in development) | HS256 signing secret, min 32 chars. **Required** when `APP_ENV` is not `development`; unset in development generates a random one per start |
| `JWT_ISSUER` | `too-good-to-go-backend` | `iss` claim, checked on every request |
| `JWT_ACCESS_TTL` | `1h` | Access token lifetime |
| `ADMIN_PHONES` | (none) | Comma separated phones that become `admin` on first login |
| `VENDOR_PHONES` | (none) | Comma separated phones that become `vendor` on first login |
| `TRUSTED_PROXIES` | (none) | Comma separated proxy IPs/CIDRs for `X-Forwarded-For` |

No secret or environment specific value is committed: `.env` is git-ignored and
only `.env.example` (placeholders and defaults) is tracked.

## Health endpoint

`GET /health` (also `HEAD`)

| Status | When |
|---|---|
| `200 OK` | Service and every registered dependency check pass |
| `503 Service Unavailable` | A dependency check fails or times out, or the server is shutting down |

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "version": "dev",
  "timestamp": "2026-10-25T10:00:00Z",
  "checks": { "postgres": { "status": "ok", "latency_ms": 3 } }
}
```

`checks` appears once dependencies are registered. To add one, implement
`serviceinterface.HealthChecker` (`Name()`, `Check(ctx)`) in the infrastructure
layer and pass it to `service.NewHealthService` in `internal/injector`.
Failure reasons are logged, never returned, because `/health` is public.

## Authentication and RBAC (JWT)

Protected routes require an HS256 access token:
`Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`.

| Method | Path | Access | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/auth/me` | any role | User id and role proven by the token |
| `GET` | `/test/customer` | `customer` | RBAC test route |
| `GET` | `/test/vendor` | `vendor` | RBAC test route |
| `GET` | `/test/admin` | `admin` | RBAC test route |

A missing, malformed, expired or wrongly signed token, a wrong issuer or
algorithm, or an unknown role gets `401 UNAUTHORIZED`; a valid token with the
wrong role gets `403 FORBIDDEN`.

Tokens are issued by `SessionService.Login` for a phone number that was
already verified by another factor (OTP). It loads or creates the user (users
are kept in memory until the Postgres repository exists); new users are
`customer` unless their number is in `ADMIN_PHONES` / `VENDOR_PHONES`. Roles of
existing users are never changed on login.

To protect a new route:

```go
group := r.Group("/vendor", authMW.Authenticate(), authMW.RequireRoles(enum.RoleVendor))
```

Handlers read the caller with `c.GetString(bootstrap.CtxKeyUserID)` and
`c.GetString(bootstrap.CtxKeyUserRole)`.

## Error response format

Every error from every endpoint (including 404, 405 and recovered panics) has
the same shape:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "NOT_FOUND",
    "message": "route not found",
    "details": null,
    "request_id": "3f2a9c..."
  }
}
```

`details` is omitted when empty; for validation errors it holds a list of
`{"field": "...", "message": "..."}`. Clients should switch on `code`, not on
`message`. 5xx responses never include internal error text.

In handlers, never write error bodies yourself. Return a typed error from
`internal/domain/exception` and attach it:

```go
if err != nil {
    _ = c.Error(err) // or the abortWithError helper in handler/helpers.go
    c.Abort()
    return
}
```

Errors that are not an `exception.AppError` become `500 INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR`.

## Logging

All logs are single-line JSON on stdout (`log/slog`). Each request produces one
`http request` entry with `request_id`, `method`, `path`, `route`, `status`,
`latency_ms`, `client_ip`, `user_agent`, and `user_id` once auth sets it.
`/health` hits are logged at debug level to avoid noise. Keys containing
`password`, `token`, `secret`, `otp`, `authorization`, `cookie` and similar are
masked as `[REDACTED]`.

The request id comes from an incoming `X-Request-ID` header (if well formed) or
is generated, and is returned in the response header and in error bodies. To
log with it from any layer:

```go
logger.FromContext(ctx, s.log).Info("offer reserved", "offer_id", id)
```

## Project layout

```
cmd/api/                  entrypoint: config, logger, server, graceful shutdown
internal/
  bootstrap/              env config and constants
  domain/                 models, enums, repository interfaces, typed exceptions
  application/            DTOs, service interfaces and implementations, workers
  infrastructure/         Postgres/Redis repositories, storage, realtime, ...
  presentation/           handlers, middleware, router
  injector/               Wire injector and generated dependency wiring
pkg/                      reusable helpers with no project dependencies (logger, ...)
docs/                     Swagger output
```

Dependency rule: `presentation → application → domain`, and `infrastructure`
implements interfaces declared in `domain`/`application`. Inner layers never
import outer ones.
